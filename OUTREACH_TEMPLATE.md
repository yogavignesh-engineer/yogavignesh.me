## The "Hook" Script Templates

### **Template 1: For Mechanical Companies (Software Role)**

**Subject:** Built a Web-Based FEA Analyzer That's Faster Than ANSYS for Quick Checks

```
Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] works on [specific engineering domain - e.g., "assembly simulations for automotive"].

I'm a Mechanical Engineer who got frustrated with how slow it is to load ANSYS just to check "what if I double this load?" — so I built a web-based Euler-Bernoulli beam analyzer that runs at 60FPS in the browser using React + WebGL.

It's not replacing FEA software, but it's faster for parametric checks during design reviews.

You can try the live simulation here: https://yogavignesh.me

Features:
- Real-time stress visualization with material properties (Steel/Aluminum/Wood)
- Exportable engineering reports for documentation
- Runs entirely client-side (no server needed, perfect for air-gapped environments)

I also built a gear kinematic calculator that generates professional reports — useful for robotics/automotive validation.

I'm looking for roles where I can build tools that solve real engineering problems, not just "looks pretty" UIs. Would love to discuss how [Company] thinks about engineering software.

### **Template 2: For Software Companies (Mechanical Domain Expertise)**

**Subject:** Mechanical Engineer Who Builds Performance-Critical Web Apps (60FPS with 3D Graphics)

```
Hi [Name],

I saw [Company]'s [specific product/feature] and thought about how mechanical engineers could use it for [specific use case].

Background: I'm a Mechanical Engineer who learned React because I wanted to build interactive engineering tools. Not "dashboards with charts" — actual kinematic analysis engines that run in the browser.

Built a "Digital Twin Engineering Suite" that includes:
- BeamVisualizer: Euler-Bernoulli deflection analysis with GPU-accelerated stress visualization
- GearCalculator: Parametric gear train analysis with CSV/PDF-ready export
- Smart Boundary System: 99.2% accuracy Computer Vision for cricket (saved ₹43L vs Hawk-Eye)

Tech stack: React 18, Three.js, WebGL, Framer Motion (60fps animations), 98 Lighthouse score

Live demo: https://yogavignesh.me

Why this matters for [Company]:
[Specific reason based on their product — e.g., "Vercel's Edge Functions could serve engineering calculations at <50ms latency for real-time simulations"]

I'm interested in Creative Technologist / Forward Deployed Engineer roles where I can bridge domain expertise with modern web tech.

Would you be open to a quick call to discuss how mechanical domain knowledge could add value to [Company]'s customers?

### **Template 3: For Startups (Product Engineer Pitch)**

**Subject:** Built Engineering Tools That Engineers Actually Use (Not Just Pretty UIs)

```
Hi [Name],

I'm a Mechanical Engineer who codes, and I noticed [Startup] is working on [specific problem].

Here's my theory: Most "engineering software" sucks because it's built by developers who don't understand the domain. They add features engineers don't need and miss the ones they do.

I built a web-based FEA beam analyzer that's FASTER than opening ANSYS for quick checks. Why? Because I've sat through 100+ design review meetings where we waste 10 minutes loading software just to test one parameter.

My approach:
1. Identify real engineering pain (slow parametric checks)
2. Build minimal viable solution (web-based, no install)
3. Add professional features engineers expect (exportable reports, formula transparency)

Result: A tool engineers actually bookmark and use daily.

Live demo: https://yogavignesh.me (try the BeamVisualizer and GearCalculator)

Tech: React + Three.js + WebGL, 98 Lighthouse score, 60fps animations

I'm looking for Product Engineer roles where I can build tools that solve real problems in [specific industry based on startup focus].

Open to chat if you're interested in someone who thinks like an engineer but builds like a developer.

Best,
S. Yoga Vignesh

## The "Live Demo" Interview Script

### When They Ask: "Tell me about your portfolio"

**❌ WRONG ANSWER:**
> "I used React and Three.js to build a portfolio with animations..."

**✅ RIGHT ANSWER:**
> "I built an engineering workbench that runs in the browser. Let me show you the export feature. [Open GearCalculator, change values, click Download] — this generates a professional engineering report with calculations, timestamps, and recommendations. I realized that engineers don't just need simulations; they need documentation for audits and compliance. So I wrote a custom serializer that captures the entire state and formats it for export. The report includes engineering notes like 'high gear ratio detected, consider multi-stage design' — that's domain knowledge baked into the tool."

### When They Ask: "Why React instead of Python/MATLAB?"

**❌ WRONG ANSWER:**
> "React is popular and I wanted to learn web development..."

**✅ RIGHT ANSWER:**
> "Because engineers work in teams, and web apps are easier to share than MATLAB scripts. If I send you a Python script, you need to install dependencies, set up environments, deal with version conflicts. If I send you a URL, you click and it works. That's why I chose React + WebGL — it runs client-side, so there's no server cost, and it works in air-gapped environments. Plus, 60fps animations make it feel responsive, which matters when you're tweaking parameters in a design review."

### When They Ask: "What's the biggest challenge you solved?"

**❌ WRONG ANSWER:**
> "Getting the animations to work smoothly..."

**✅ RIGHT ANSWER:**
> "Making the physics correct while keeping it performant. In BeamVisualizer, I show the Euler-Bernoulli equation because I don't want to hide the math — engineers need to verify the formula. But I also needed 60fps animations, which meant using GPU acceleration and avoiding React re-renders. The solution was Framer Motion's MotionValues, which update without triggering component re-renders. That's how I got real-time sliders with complex physics calculations running smoothly."

## Cold Email Strategy

### **Step 1: Find the Right Person**

**NOT HR.** Find:
- Engineering Managers (search "[Company] Engineering Manager" on LinkedIn)
- Technical Leads (look for "Lead Engineer" or "Staff Engineer")
- CTOs of startups (<50 employees)
- Developer Relations Engineers (they love interactive demos)

### **Step 2: The LinkedIn DM**

```
Hi [Name],

Quick question: Does [Company] ever need web-based engineering tools for [specific domain]?

I built a browser-based FEA analyzer that's faster than ANSYS for quick parametric checks. It's React + WebGL, runs at 60fps, and generates exportable reports.

Live demo: https://yogavignesh.me

Not spam — genuinely curious if this solves a problem at [Company]. Would appreciate 60 seconds of your time to check it out.

Thanks,
Yoga Vignesh
```

### **Step 3: The Follow-Up (If No Response After 3 Days)**

```
Hi [Name],

Following up on my message about web-based engineering tools.

I added a feature this week: The gear calculator now exports professional engineering reports (PDF-ready) with calculations, timestamps, and recommendations.

Thought you might find it interesting: https://yogavignesh.me

Would love your feedback as an engineer.

Thanks,
Yoga

## Reddit/Twitter Strategy

### **Post Title (Reddit r/engineering or r/webdev)**

> "Built a 60FPS FEA beam analyzer in React because I was tired of waiting for ANSYS to load"

### **Post Content**

```
I'm a Mechanical Engineer, and during design reviews, we waste SO much time loading ANSYS just to test "what if we double this load?"

So I built a web-based Euler-Bernoulli beam analyzer that runs at 60fps using React + WebGL.

Features:
- Real-time stress visualization with material properties
- Shows the actual physics equation (no hiding math)
- Exportable engineering reports for documentation
- 98 Lighthouse score (faster load than most engineering software)

Tech stack: React 18, Three.js, Framer Motion

Live demo: https://yogavignesh.me (try BeamVisualizer)

Not trying to replace ANSYS — just wanted something fast for parametric checks.

Feedback welcome! Is this useful, or am I solving a problem that doesn't exist?
